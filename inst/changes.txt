4/1/2004: minor changes to documentation, for 'foodweb' and 'README.mvbutils'. The latter is mostly concerned with ESS use.

6/1/2004: changed '.First.lib' so it no longer incorrectly complains about missing 'tasks' when 'tasks' is actually present but without an element named "mvbutils".

6/1/2004: changed 'write.mvb.tasks' so that it *appends* the new tasks vector to the file "tasks.R". This makes it easier to retrieve old task lists that get accidentally screwed up.

18/2/2004: changed 'formalize.package' so that it puts README.xxx documentation into 00README.xxx.Rd files rather than duplicating it. 

  Also removed '.README.mvbutils' which is now superfluous (use README.mvbutils instead).

  Also minor bug fix to .First.lib, allowing 'mvbutils' itself to be used as a task.

7/3/2004: added 'mvb.parent.frame' to complement 'mvb.sys.parent' etc.

7/2/2005: added support for lazy-loading of individual objects ("cacheing") in 'mlazy' etc.

  Added support for image files that aren't just called ".Rdata"-- in particular, for "R/all.rda" files in packages, and lazy-loading databases in "R" subdirectories. The latter is pretty experimental though.

  Fixed buggy 'on.exit' in 'mlocal' functions; use 'local.on.exit' instead
  
  Added 'make.internal.doc' and 'make.NAMESPACE' for formalizing packages
  
  Changed 'create.backups' to only create new backup files; made it automatic in 'Save.pos'
  
  Fixed various things broken by R2.0, including the flatdoc extensions to 'help' (which had stopped the entire help system working).
  
11/2/2005: NAMESPACEd it and removed a couple of superfluous functions.

10/5/2005: Fixed a bug with 'Save' and changed the history file mechanisms.

  Changed the default in 'option.or.default' to NULL.
  
  Fixed some bugs wrto operators in 'formalize.package', plus some doco infelicities.

1/7/2005: Allow relative paths in task directories, of the form ./subtask

  Fixed semibug where user changes task directory name outside R, then tries to 'cd' to it.
  
26/7/2005: 'fixr' etc now cope with text objects (stored as character vectors) as well as functions.

6/8/2005: fixed bug in 'FF' whereby the end of the source code would be lost from functions whose syntax is "accidentally" complete .

15/8/2005: 'cd' now does not change the old .Rdata file at all unless necessary; this reduces overhead when trying to keep multiple machines in synch. Further, objects '.Random.seed', '.Traceback', and 'last.warning' are automatically 'mlazy'ed on 'cd'. This *DOES* mean that the .Rdata file is *NO LONGER* guaranteed to contain *all* the objects in a workspace even if the user hasn't directly called 'mlazy'. To transfer all the objects, you need to copy all the "obj{n}.rda" files as well as .Rdata.

9/9/2005: fixed bug in replacement 'help' that was screwing up 'help.search' on MACs with AQUA.

13/9/2005: altered 'formalize.package' to handle "blah-package" documentation and "changes.txt" object or file.

2/11/2005: base 'save.image' now overwritten by default, to call 'Save' instead. This ensures that quitting via 'q()' works OK. 'Save' will not be called if 'save.image' is invoked with non-standard parameters.

13/12/2005: 'foodweb' now works with 'where=<<environment>>', e.g. 'where=asNamespace( "stats")' (changed 'called.by' too)

14/12/2005: 'mlazy' now by default saves cached objects into a subdirectory called "mlazy". Also, you can now 'mlazy' an object called "x" or "mc"-- formerly, these two names (only) would not have worked.

  Bug fix in 'formalize.package'-- no longer creates "internal" documentation for '.First.lib', '.onLoad', or '.onAttach'.
  
  The seemingly alarming warning "MVBUTILS-- no 'tasks' vector found in ROOT", encountered when 'mvbutils' is loaded in a context without the 'cd' system in place, has been removed.
