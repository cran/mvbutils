4/1/2004: minor changes to documentation, for 'foodweb' and 'README.mvbutils'. The latter is mostly concerned with ESS use.

6/1/2004: changed '.First.lib' so it no longer incorrectly complains about missing 'tasks' when 'tasks' is actually present but without an element named "mvbutils".

6/1/2004: changed 'write.mvb.tasks' so that it *appends* the new tasks vector to the file "tasks.R". This makes it easier to retrieve old task lists that get accidentally screwed up.

18/2/2004: changed 'formalize.package' so that it puts README.xxx documentation into 00README.xxx.Rd files rather than duplicating it. 

  Also removed '.README.mvbutils' which is now superfluous (use README.mvbutils instead).

	Also minor bug fix to .First.lib, allowing 'mvbutils' itself to be used as a task.

7/3/2004: added 'mvb.parent.frame' to complement 'mvb.sys.parent' etc.

7/2/2005: added support for lazy-loading of individual objects ("cacheing") in 'mlazy' etc.

  Added support for image files that aren't just called ".Rdata"-- in particular, for "R/all.rda" files in packages, and lazy-loading databases in "R" subdirectories. The latter is pretty experimental though.

  Fixed buggy 'on.exit' in 'mlocal' functions; use 'local.on.exit' instead
  
  Added 'make.internal.doc' and 'make.NAMESPACE' for formalizing packages
  
  Changed 'create.backups' to only create new backup files; made it automatic in 'Save.pos'
  
  Fixed various things broken by R2.0, including the flatdoc extensions to 'help' (which had stopped the entire help system working).
  
11/2/2005: NAMESPACEd it and removed a couple of superfluous functions.

10/5/2005: Fixed a bug with 'Save' and changed the history file mechanisms.

  Changed the default in 'option.or.default' to NULL.
  
  Fixed some bugs wrto operators in 'formalize.package', plus some doco infelicities.
