4/1/2004: minor changes to documentation, for 'foodweb' and 'README.mvbutils'. The latter is mostly concerned with ESS use.

6/1/2004: changed '.First.lib' so it no longer incorrectly complains about missing 'tasks' when 'tasks' is actually present but without an element named "mvbutils".

6/1/2004: changed 'write.mvb.tasks' so that it *appends* the new tasks vector to the file "tasks.R". This makes it easier to retrieve old task lists that get accidentally screwed up.

18/2/2004: changed 'formalize.package' so that it puts README.xxx documentation into 00README.xxx.Rd files rather than duplicating it. 

  Also removed '.README.mvbutils' which is now superfluous (use README.mvbutils instead).

	Also minor bug fix to .First.lib, allowing 'mvbutils' itself to be used as a task.
